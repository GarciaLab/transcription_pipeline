    Constructs a trackpy-compatible pandas Dataframe of proposed spot locations after
    bandpass-filtering, thresholding and removing small objects, adding a column for
    the raw spot data. If a Dask Client is passed as a `client` kwarg, the bandpass
    filtering and thresholding will be parallelized across the client.

    :param spot_movie: Movie of spot channel.
    :type spot_movie: np.ndarray
    :param low_sigma: Sigma to use as the low-pass filter (mainly filters out
        noise). Can be given as float (assumes isotropic sigma) or as sequence/array
        (each element corresponsing the sigma along of the image axes).
    :type low_sigma: {np.float, tuple[np.float]}
    :param high_sigma: Sigma to use as the high-pass filter (removes structured
        background and dims down areas where nuclei are close together that might
        start to coalesce under other morphological operations). Can be given as float
        (assumes isotropic sigma) or as sequence/array (each element corresponsing the
        sigma along of the image axes).
    :type high_sigma: {np.float, tuple[np.float]}
    :param dict frame_metadata: Dictionary of frame-by-frame metadata for all files and
        series in a dataset.
    :param span: Size of neighborhood to extract (rounded in each axis to the largest
        odd number below `span` if even).
    :type span: np.ndarray
    :param pos_columns: Name of columns in DataFrame measurement table obtained from
        spot label array containing a position coordinate, in order of indexing of
        the input `spot_movie`.
    :type pos_columns: list of DataFrame column names
    :param int nbins: Number of bins used to construct image histogram for automatic
        thresholding.
    :param threshold: Threshold below which to clip `spot_movie` after bandpass filter.
        Note that bandpass filtering forces a conversion to normalized float, so the
        threshold should not exceed 1. Setting `threshold="triangle"` uses automatic
        thresholding using the triangle method.
    :type threshold: {"triangle", float}
    :param float threshold_factor: If using automated thresholding, this factor is multiplied
        by the proposed threshold value. This gives some degree of control over the stringency
        of thresholding while still getting a ballpark value using the automated method.
    :param int min_size: The smallest allowable object size.
    :param int connectivity: The connectivity defining the neighborhood of a pixel
        during small object removal.
    :param bool return_bandpass: If True, returns bandpass-filtered movie as
        third element of output. Otherwise returns none as third output.
    :param bool keep_futures_bandpass: If `True`, keeps generated bandpass-filtered movie
        as a list of `Futures` in the Dask worker memories, returning as a list in fourth output.
    :param bool return_spot_labels: If True, returns labelled spot mask as
        second element of output. Otherwise returns none as second output.
    :param bool keep_futures_spot_labels: If `True`, keeps generated labelled mask as a list of
        `Futures` in the Dask worker memories, returning as a list in second output.
    :param bool return_spot_dataframe: If True, returns fully evaluated dataframe of
        labelled spots as first output (otherwise returns `None`).
    :param bool keep_futures_spot_dataframe: If `True`, keeps dataframe of labelled
        spots as a list of `Futures` in the Dask worker memories.
    :param bool keep_futures_spots_movie: If `True`, keeps dataframe of input `spot_movie`
        as a list of `Futures` in the Dask worker memories.
    :param extra_properties: Properties of each labelled region in the segmentation
        mask to measure and add to the DataFrame. With no extra properties, the
        DataFrame will have columns only for the frame, label, and centroid
        coordinates.
    :type extra_properties: tuple[str]
    :param bool drop_reverse_time: If True, drops the columns with reversed frame
        numbers added to facilitate tracking (if you are using nuclear tracking to
        track your spots instead of tracking the spots independently, you might not
        need these columns).
    :param client: Dask client to send the computation to.
    :type client: `dask.distributed.client.Client` object.
